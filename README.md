**Nitro** is a futuristic blazingly fast embeddable framework for distributed app development, IoT, edge and p2p.

## Overview

Nitro will provide the core requirements for distributed app development, IoT, edge and p2p including RPC and Event driven communication. 
The Nitro mantra is in-memory defaults with a pluggable architecture. Blaze with pure in-memory development and swap out as needed 
to go multi-process or multi-host.

Note: Nitro is currently undergoing a complete rewrite and is considered unstable for use.

## Features

Nitro focuses on dapps, IoT, edge and p2p. 

Features in development:

- [x] Lightweight RPC based communication
- [x] Event broadcasting and notifications
- [ ] CRDT Data synchronisation and storage
- [ ] Consensus protocol and execution engine
- [ ] WebAssembly target compilation support
- [ ] Unique randomized token generation aka BLS
- [ ] P2P gossip networking stack in userspace

## Future

In the future there's the potential to launch a live network based on Nitro. More on that soon.
